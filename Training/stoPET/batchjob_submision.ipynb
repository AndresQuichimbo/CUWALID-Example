    "In order to run the CUWALID model, we use the High Performance Computers (HPC) provided by institutes. These HPC's are better for running multiple jobs at the same time. This will save time and allow us to run models that use large data.\n",

    "### 1.1 creating directories to hold necessary files\n",
    "The first step we need to do is create three important directories in our home directory. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* bSub_runME\n",
    "* bSub_logME\n",
    "* bSub_doneME\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create these directories by runing the mkdir command in the terminal. Here is the command\n",

    "* `mkdir bSub_logME`\n",
    "* `mkdir bSub_doneME`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you create these directories you can use them anytime for any job submission (i.e No need to make these directories everytime).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do we use these three directories?\n",
    "The **bSub_runME** directory is used to save our bash files (e.g ***myjob.bash***) that contain all the necessary submission commands and the job to be run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **bSub_logME** directory is used to save error files and output files from the job we are running. If there isan error and the job is cancelled you can go tho this directory and read the error message in the ***jobid.error*** file. If there are any print statments in your job or any other print that would have been printed on the terminal will be saved in the ***jonid.out*** file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **bSub_doneME** directory is used to save our bash files (e.g ***myjob.bash***) after the job is submitted. Hence, if there is an error and you have to run the job again you can easily move the bash files from this directory to the bSub_runME directory without creating them again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Creating the bash files\n",
    "In order to submit multiple jobs to HPC, we need to follow certain commands that are set by the institute. Hence, we can prepare a python script to write these bash files so that we save time to write each file mannually. The following python script **write_bash_files.py** is provided to prepare the bash files used in the job sumbission. Below, we will discuss how it works using one example function in the script.\n"
